- data: Directory responsible for containing everything related to our data
- data/services/service: Contain most of the business logic
- data/services/repo: Persist data in the database, perform SQL queries, fetch API.
- data/model: Our classes, or data models responsible for abstracting our objects.

- modules: Each module consists of a page, its respective GetXController and its dependencies or Bindings. We treat each screen as an independent module, as it has its only controller, and can also contain its dependencies. If you use reusable widgets in this, and only in this module, you can choose to add a folder for them.

- global_widgets: Widgets that can be reused by multiple **modules**.
